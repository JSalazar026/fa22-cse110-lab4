Question 1 Answer: The bug was that since the inputs to the calculateSum function were strings, the string representations of the numbers typed into the text boxes were being concatenated together.

Question 2 Answer: I would use convert the data type of the parameters num1 and num2 from strings to numbers in the calculateSum function with the use of the Number() function and add these converted numbers together, returning this new numeric result.
